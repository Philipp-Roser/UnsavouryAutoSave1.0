# UnsavouryAutoSave 1.0

Note: Depricated. Better functionality is provided by UnsavouryAutoSave 1.1.

Micro-App that simulates Ctrl-S being pressed at user-defined intervals, to imitate autosave functionality in applications that don't natively support it. Requires target program to have Ctrl-S as its "save" shortcut. 

Keep open in background while using target app (e.g. text editor).
